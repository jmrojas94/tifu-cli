## TIFU CLI

A simple cli to read posts on the ["Today I F'd Up"](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/) subreddit right from your command line!

### Installation

If "Choose Title" is chosen, a list of titles will appear for you to choose from. When a title is chosen, the body of the post will be displayed for you to read.

If "Random" is chosen, a random post will be displayed.

After reading, you will be prompted to choose if you want to read another post or exit.
